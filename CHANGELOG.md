# Changelog

## [1.1.2] — 2026-03-27

### Fixed
- **Short position sizing** (`sizing.py`): `borrow` was calculated as `(lev-1)×seed/price`
  (1× seed at 2x leverage), giving only 1× price exposure in paper P&L. The MCP
  flash-loan loop actually creates `supply=(lev+1)×seed` USDC and `borrow=lev×seed`
  asset on-chain. Fixed to `borrow = seed × lev / price` — 2× seed at 2x leverage.
- **Paper health factor** (`main.py`): `_paper_health_factor` used `leverage×supply×lt`
  for shorts, under-stating the true Aave collateral (which is `(lev+1)×seed`). Fixed
  to `(leverage+1)×supply×lt` — now returns HF ≈ 1.17 at 2x short open (matches Aave).
- **Short carry APR** (`main.py`): carry formula `supply_apy×lev − borrow_apy×(lev−1)`
  was wrong for the same reason. Fixed to `supply_apy×(lev+1) − borrow_apy×lev`.
  At 2x with current rates: 5.71% (was 4.08%).
- **Signal reversal fires on `hold`** (`main.py`): `hold` has score=0, same as
  `strong_short`. The condition `sig.score <= signal_reversal_min_score` (default 1)
  was triggering reversal exits on `hold` signals. Fixed by adding `sig.direction ==
  "short"` check — `hold` (direction=none) no longer triggers reversal.
- **Exit ordering** (`main.py`): TP/SL (price-based, deterministic) now runs before
  signal reversal (signal-based). Previously a signal reversal could preempt an SL
  that should have fired at the same price.
- **F&G short filter too aggressive** (`filters.py`, `config.py`): Filter 5 blocked
  shorts whenever F&G ≤ 15 (extreme fear), even in sustained downtrends where RSI had
  recovered from oversold. Added `fear_greed_short_rsi_floor` gate: the block lifts once
  RSI climbs above this value (default 35), indicating the oversold bounce is done.
- **Short carry APY fields** (`market.py`): Added `usdc_supply_apy` and
  `asset_borrow_apy` to `MarketData` and cycle log — raw rates from `get_position`
  reserveRates response.
- **pnl.py docstring**: Updated to reflect correct borrow definition (`lev×seed/price`).
- **config.example.yml**: `signal_reversal_min_score` default corrected to `1`
  (moderate+strong reversal); added `fear_greed_short_rsi_floor: 35.0`.

## [1.1.1] — 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- **RSI overbought scoring** (`ohlcv.py`): EMA-bull + RSI > 75 (overbought) incorrectly
  scored as `moderate_long` instead of `hold`. Added explicit `overbought`/`oversold`
  guards — those edge cases now correctly resolve to hold.
- **Position size truthiness bug** (`main.py`): `eff_supply or float(...)` evaluated
  `False` when effective size was 0.0, producing wrong P&L and HF values. Replaced with
  explicit `> 0` comparisons throughout.
- **Concurrent write corruption** (`state.py`): `append_entry` now acquires an exclusive
  `fcntl.flock` before writing, preventing interleaved output under concurrent processes.
- **Malformed log line handling** (`state.py`): `load_entries` now skips malformed JSON
  lines with a warning instead of crashing the cycle.
- **Deferred import** (`onchain.py`): moved `import requests` from inside the function
  body to top-level; replaced with `httpx` for consistency.
- **Config example default** (`config.example.yml`): `max_recent_liquidations` corrected
  from `10` to `3` to match the `config.py` default.

## [1.1.0] — 2026-03-25

### Added — OHLCV signal (primary signal engine)
- **EMA crossover + RSI on hourly candles**: Coinbase Exchange public API
  (`api.exchange.coinbase.com`) → Kraken fallback. EMA(12/26) crossover gives trend
  direction; RSI(14) gives momentum zone. Scores 0–4 map to the same labels as the
  CoinGecko 3-timeframe engine (`strong_long` / `moderate_long` / `hold` /
  `moderate_short` / `strong_short`).
- **Signal hierarchy changed**: OHLCV is now the primary signal. CoinGecko 3-timeframe
  is used only as a last-resort fallback when both Coinbase and Kraken are unavailable.
- Cycle entry now includes `tech_signal`, `tech_ema_bull`, `tech_rsi`, `tech_source`,
  and `cg_signal` fields for full auditability.

### Added — Position increase (moderate → strong signal upgrade)
- When a `moderate_long` or `moderate_short` position is open and the signal upgrades
  to `strong_long` / `strong_short`, the bot tops up the half-size position to full
  size instead of doing nothing. Only one increase per trade is allowed.
- `compute_increase()` added to `sizing.py` — computes the delta between current seed
  and the full-strength target.
- `increase_position()` added to `executor.py` — paper stub logs; live mode calls
  `prepare_increase` on the MCP server.
- `get_effective_size()` and `has_been_increased()` added to `state.py` — read increase
  entries from `trades.jsonl` to compute accurate effective supply/borrow for P&L and HF.
- `prepare_increase()` added to `mcp_client.py`.

### Added — Exit strategy
- **Signal reversal exit**: close position when all 3 timeframes flip against it
  (`signal_reversal_exit`, `signal_reversal_min_score: 0`)
- **Minimum hold time**: prevent whipsaw closes within `min_hold_hours` of opening
- **Time-based exit**: close after `max_hold_days` to prevent carry drag and HF drift
- **TP suppression on strong signal**: when `tp_on_strong_signal: false` (default),
  take-profit is skipped if the signal is still at maximum strength — let winners ride.
  Stop-loss always applies regardless.

### Added — Data sources
- **Binance/Bybit/OKX funding rate**: perp funding rate in % per 8h. Chain tries
  Binance → Bybit → OKX (Binance/Bybit geo-blocked on US IPs). Soft source — never
  blocks the cycle on failure.
- **Fear & Greed Index** (alternative.me): 0–100 sentiment score. Soft source.
- **CoinGecko 24h volume**: already fetched, now extracted and logged each cycle.

### Added — On-chain Aave v3 Base data (via Alchemy or public RPC)
- **USDC pool utilization**: reads `varDebtToken.totalSupply() / aToken.totalSupply()`
  directly from Base. Suppresses new entries when > `max_usdc_utilization` (default 92%)
  — Aave's interest rate curve kinks sharply at ~90%.
- **Recent liquidation count**: `eth_getLogs` for `LiquidationCall` events on Aave v3
  Pool in last `onchain_lookback_blocks` blocks (~20s with free Alchemy tier, ~5 min
  with PAYG). Suppresses entries during cascades.
- Configurable `rpc_url` (default: `https://mainnet.base.org`; Alchemy for getLogs).
- Configurable `onchain_lookback_blocks` (default 10; set 150 with Alchemy PAYG).

### Added — No-trade filters
- **Filter 4**: Funding rate — suppresses longs if funding > `max_funding_rate_long`
  (crowded longs) or shorts if funding < `-max_funding_rate_short` (crowded shorts).
- **Filter 5**: Fear & Greed — suppresses longs if F&G ≥ `max_fear_greed_long` (extreme
  greed) or shorts if F&G ≤ `min_fear_greed_short` (extreme fear / capitulation).
- **Filter 6**: Volume — suppresses entries if 24h volume < `min_volume_24h_usd` (disabled
  by default; set a threshold once you have baseline volume data).
- **Filter 7**: USDC utilization — suppresses entries if > `max_usdc_utilization`.
- **Filter 8**: Liquidation cascade — suppresses entries if recent liquidations >
  `max_recent_liquidations` within the lookback window.

### Added — Short position support (HF-aware)
- Short-specific HF thresholds: `short_hf_defense_reduce`, `short_hf_defense_close`,
  `short_min_open_hf` — all must be below 1.17 (2x short open HF).
- `short_max_leverage` hard cap (default 2.0) enforced in sizing.py regardless of
  `leverage` config.

### Fixed
- **Paper trading HF simulation**: paper mode no longer reads real on-chain HF.
  Instead computes simulated HF from paper position parameters using Aave v3 Base
  liquidation thresholds (WETH=0.83, cbBTC=0.78, USDC=0.78). Prevents paper bot
  from triggering hf_close based on unrelated real wallet positions.
- **Signal zero-change neutrality**: all-zero price changes (flat market / missing data)
  now correctly return `hold` with multiplier=0.0 instead of `strong_short`.
- **Market price guard**: explicit check that price is non-None after 2-of-3 source
  quorum — prevents sizing with stale data if CoinGecko fails but quorum still passes.
- **OKX funding rate fallback**: Binance returns HTTP 451 and Bybit HTTP 403 on AWS
  US IPs; OKX is accessible globally without auth.
